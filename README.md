# Nicolas Cage Discord Bot
This a bot using the discord.py API

What started out as a joke has evolved into a fun little side project
If you want to know where the inspiration came from, see my other repo and site [movieboys.us](https://movieboys.us/)
Initially I just wanted a bot that could send a quote to a channel from a Nic Cage movie.
After that I got it to join a voice channel and send an audio clip.

My friends and I have a Discord channel where we share videos and vote on the best one of the week.
We were talking about repeat post and someone said there should be a bot that can tell you if there is a repeat.
Fast forward to now and Nic Cage Bot does that.

On startup this bot will read all the messages in a specified channel and then listen for new links.
It will notify the poster if they have posted a youtube link that was previously posted.

Works for normal desktop, mobile, and shorts links from youtube (some excpetions)
Uses regx to parse the links.

Thanks for checking it out. Leave a star if you enjoy.
